### How to run ? 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️

#### Backend 🚀

First of all, it's a node project don't forget the basics

```sh
npm install
```



Then copy the .env.example file into .env

Complete variables with your database settings

Don't forget to smash your keyboard with random keys for the `APP_SECRET`

For the `BCRYPT_ROUNDS` we recommend you 10 but if you feel like waiting days for hashs you could set it to 31

For the `MODE` dev is already what you want right ? Otherwise type anything else.

#### Frontend 💄

For the frontend nothing is required other than the precious command !!!

```sh
npm install
```
